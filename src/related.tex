% In order to deploy the robot task on embedded systems, a series of works have involved special hardware architectures for high energy efficiency. 
% There are two kinds of hardware design for embedded moving robot: one is to design a special acceleration for a specific task; the other is to design CNN accelerators and use CNN to do the task.

% \subsection{ Accelerators for a specific robot task }

% The feature-point extraction (FE) operation is the fundamental component of a vision-based robot, and is also one of the most time-consuming components \cite{fang2017fpga}.
% Some previous works design hardware architectures for FE.
% SRI-SURF \cite{jia2016sri} optimizes the memory access to speed up SURF \cite{bay2006surf} feature-point extraction. 
% \cite{fang2017fpga} directly implements ORB on FPGA using HLS. eSLAM \cite{liu2019eslam} optimizes the ORB algorithm and designs hardware for better performance.
% Some other works design architectures for the entire robot system. Hero \cite{shi2018hero} is a framework for navigation and laser-based robot and cannot support vision-based robots that are much more lightweight and cheaper. 
% \cite{li2019879gops} introduces CNN accelerators for the vision-based robot. 
% However, the CNN accelerator in this work \cite{li2019879gops} is only used for feature-point extraction, and the accelerator is not to support different tasks at the same time. 
% Deploying multiple CNNs on the robotic accelerator can expand the functions of robots, without designing hardware for specific functions.



% \subsection{ CNN accelerators }

To accelerate CNN, some previous works design frameworks to generate a specific hardware architecture for a target CNN, based on RTL \cite{li_high_2016} or HLS \cite{lu_evaluating_2017}. These works need to reconfigure the FPGA to switch between different CNN models. The reconfiguration consumes seconds \cite{FPGAPerformance}, which is unacceptable for the real-time system.
Some other works design instruction-driven accelerators \cite{yu2018instruction,qiu2016going,guo2017angel,dpu}, making rapid switching possible by providing different instruction sequences. 
However, the CNN tasks on previous instruction-driven CNN accelerators are not interruptible, resulting in the latency-sensitive high-priority task waiting for the low-priority task to finish. 
This inability of CNN accelerators to support multi-task makes it difficult for robotic researchers to use embedded FPGA.
